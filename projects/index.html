<h2 id="general-research-interests">General research interests:</h2>
As a staunch supporter of system theory, my consistent research interest lies in mining valuable, holistic, and general knowledge and insights from  extensive biological big data.
<ul>
<li><p><code>Genotype-phenotype connections</code> From the perspective of genetics, one of my major goals is to uncover the hidden genotype-phenotype links. Given the current assumptions are still quite rudimentary, biologically-inspired new models (heterogeneity, regulatory networks, etc.) are very likely to be used to unveil new discoveries within vast existing datasets.</p></li>

<li><p><code>RNA & protein kinetics</code> Transcription initiates the process of translating genetic information into functions. Despite the extensive content in molecular biology textbooks, our grasp of this process remains far from comprehensive. My focus encompasses fundamental transcription processes, particularly those related to structural variations (such as alternative splicing, gene fusion, etc.), which piques my strong interest. Furthermore, I would like to investigate various post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications that profoundly influence functional execution. These modifications tend to operate independently of genetic information and exhibit adaptable responses to environmental shifts, spanning from cellular to individual-level changes.</p></li>

<li><p><code>The game and business between plants and microbes</code> My belief in the role of microbes has been bolstered by the significant improvement in my diarrhea issues after consuming dietary supplements containing gut flora (without any conflict of interest). My curiosity turns towards understanding the significance of microbes in the context of plants: how they fight, trade, or take what they want in a temporary balance with each other. Microorganisms emerge as a pivotal biotic factor that contributes to comprehending GxE.</p></li>

<li><p><code>Systematic approaches in genetic enhancement</code> We are presently presented with a remarkable opportunity to reconfigure the genetic code to advance breeding improvement, whether by augmenting existing phenotypes or engineering entirely new traits. Integrating the knowledge gleaned from the above areas with additional systematic genomic strategies can expedite this process significantly. This encompasses refining the predictability of gene editing, aiding in the optimization of gene editing tools, and harnessing genome selection for precision breeding predictions.</p></li>

</ul>

 <p><h2 id="current-projects">Current Projects:</h2>
<!-- 
<p> Hopefully, we could then get more optimistic in facing the complexity and beauty of LIFE.</p>
-->
<ul>
<li><p><code>Contributions of genetic heterogeneity to complex traits</code> Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are now a routine tool for complex traits â€” and it is widely recognized that only a tiny fraction of the genetic variation can be explained using mappable loci. Although the simplest explanation for this remains polygenicity, genetic heterogeneity may also contribute. I am working on developing a new pipeline to deal with the genetic heterogeneity in plants.</p></li>

<li><p><code>Discovering dna methylation directly from pacbio long-reads</code> Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is considered the "golden standard" in DNA methylation identification, however, usually &lt;80% of BS-seq reads (100~150bp) can be uniquely mapped leaving many regions unexplored. Particularly, those un- &amp; multi- mappable sequences (e.g. repeated elements) are highly interesting with regard to epigenetics. Long-read sequencing (LRS) technology provides nearly complete genome coverage, as well as, fortunately, the modification information. In this project, I would like to improve the present approach of reading epigenetic modifications directly from the raw sequencing data. Through the construction of the PAN-methylome in Arabidopsis, we would next discover the links between complex genetic variations and DNA methylation.</p></li>

<li><p><code>The 1001 phenome project</code> The availability of the 1001 genomes has been pivotal for the Arabidopsis community in conducting GWAS. These GWAS have been conducted on a variety of phenotypes. Exempt for some, these phenotypes have always been measured on subsets of utmost a couple of hundred accessions. In this project, we generated high-quality phenotypes for 1000 accessions from the 1001 collection. The high number of accessions and the finely controlled environment should make this data very powerful to find genetic associations, and highlighting the dynamics of genetic architecture.</p></li>

<li><p><code>The 1001g+ project</code> Given the massive development of long-read sequencing technologies, the era is approaching when every individual has her/his/its own complete genome. I use Arabidopsis as a model to explore how much mistakes had been made and how hidden/new biology could be obtained with population/species-level (nearly) full genomes.</p></li>
